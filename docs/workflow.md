# [Workflow](/README.md)

1. We will start by getting a new page to work on by using the Hexo new command
2. We open to the Blog folder using Visual Studio Code
3. Find the new .md file and start editing, any images can be dropped into the folder of this same article name.  The nice thing about using Visual Studio Code is that you can get a preview of the .md pages.
4. Save the pages and go to the git section and check in the pages.
5. When you sync up with the remote git repository on TFS, this will cause the pages to be generated and packaged up
6. The build will trigger the deployment so make sure that ALM-Test is up and running as it uses that for staging.
7. Enjoy the new blog at http://www.donaldonsoftware.com
