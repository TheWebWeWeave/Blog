Ah yes, you have arrived at the very strange world of Donald on Software.  I'm Donald Schulz your host.  Almost everything you see here is written by me, and it reflects my (shall-we-say) uniquie sensibilities about software development and what ever I find interesting.

I was a software developer in Los Angeles with more than 20 years of experience.  I am originally from Canada and relocated in 1998 to work for One, Inc until they folded after the colapse of the dot com boom in January 2002.  I have my own company, [The Web We Weave, Inc.](http://www.thewebweweave.net) which makes [AGP Maker](http://www.agpmaker.com), the Software used to simplify the Awards and Graduation programs in High Schools.  

I currently work as an [ALM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management) and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) Consultant for [Imaginet](http://www.Imaginet.com) and travel all over the [United States and Canada](http://binged.it/1NRvP6B) providing guidance and recommendations to our clients on improving their process, culture and tooling to develop better software.  You can learn more about me personnaly by reading what I write.


## How Often Do New Things Appear Here?
"Whether or not I put things up will depend largely on whether, on a particular day, I have anything to put up," to paraphrase McSweeneys. 

## So, Am I Supposed to Check Back Every Day?
Don't bother.  Subscribe to my RSS feed.  You will find the white RSS icon link at the top of each page is a direct link to my atom formated RSS feed or you can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/donaldlschulz)  Any time I put up a new posting I will announce it on twitter.

## But You're Completely Wrong. How Can I Let You Know?
Ah, yes, for this purpose I have comments turned on for each and every article that I write.  Please, no flames, no all caps, no crap.  No one replying just to be the first to reply.  In an attempt to reduce or eliminate spam from the comment section, all anonymous comments will go through an approval process in an attempt to reduce or eliminate spam or at least not plugging the comment section with it.  However, you can register on [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and as a registered user you will be able to enter comments immediately without going through this approval step.
