In all my blog posts that I have written over the years have I have never talked about health or a healthy lifestyle.  This will be a first and you as a technology person might be wondering what has living a Vegan Lifestyle have anything to do with software.  After all the blog title is "Donald on Sofware".

For years I would go through these decade birthdays and just remark how turning thirty was just like turning twenty execept I had all the extra knowlege called life. Going from thirty to forty, same thing but things took a turn when I moved into my fifties.  I have had doctors notice that my blood pressure was a bit elevated.  I took longer to recover from physical activites.  Felt aches I never noticed before and I promised my wife that I would live a long, long time and that wasn't feeling all that convincing.  I didn't have the same get up and go that I had known before.

## A Bit About My Family
My wife and step daughter have been vegitarian/vegans for many years.  I was open to other types of food like plant based meals and would eat them on occation when we were at a vegan restaurant or that was what was being cooked at home.  However, I travel alot so most of my food would be from a restauant where I could eat anything I wanted.  This went on for several years, I was taking a mild blood pressure pill every day.  This was keeping my blood pressure under control but there were other things that it appeared to be affecting as well in a negative way.

## The Turning Point for Me
During Thanksgiving weekend in November 2014, Mary (my wife) and I watched a documentary on Netflix called "Forks over Knives", and at the end of that I vowed never to eat meat again and start moving towards a Vegan lifestyle.  The documenary is about two doctors one that came from the medical field and one from the science side of things and their adventure to unravelling the the truth about how the food that we eat is related to health.  One of the biggest studies that has ever been done is called "The China Study" and is a 20 year study that examines the relationship between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, breat cancer, prostate cancer and bowel cancer.

Not only reducing these numbers but now that the toxic animal products were out of our system, our bodies would start to repair some of this damage that we have always been told could never be repairable naturally.
