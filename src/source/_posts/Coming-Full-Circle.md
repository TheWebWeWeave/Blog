I have recently changed jobs and the whole experience has made me take a step back and take a look at where I have come from.  What roads did I have to cross to get here.   My current position is working with various business units of a large company to adopt a DevOps culture.  For the past nine years I have been working as a consultant helping clients to achieve a better DevOps experience around TFS and then Azure DevOps.  Today I am in an environment that is not centered around Microsoft tooling, there are some products that they build that are but this is a very minor number compared to the other technology that is going on here.  There is a bit of a learning curve for me as far as the technology goes, but the basic concepts of a DevOps culture are the same and that is what I will bring to the table and as far as the different tools go, I am really ready for some new challanges.

How did I get here and what makes me qualified to bring a DevOps culture to a large organization.  First in case you don't know I think we should define what DevOps really is.
