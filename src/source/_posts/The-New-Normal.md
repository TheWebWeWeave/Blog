Welcome to the rest of your life. Right now we are in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and I hear people talking about the first things they want to do when things get back to normal.  We need to re-think what our interpretation of Normal is going to be, unless we are willing to make some serious changes.  If you think that Covid-19 was bad, the next one is going to be even worse.  What are these changes I am proposing, why it is being **Vegan, whole food plant based** and give up all animal products and that isn't just the meat, but includes, Dairy, Eggs and Honey.
## Why go Vegan?
Going Vegan is good on several fronts and here are a few to get you started.  {% img right /images/GoVegan.jpg 300 300 "Go Vegan" %}
1. It is good for the **Environment.**  Did you know that most of the global warming is caused by methane gases that go up into the atmosphere and most of that gas is coming from the large herds of cattle that we are raising.  We are cutting down the rain forests in Brazil not to grow more food for the over 2 billion humans that live on this planet.  It is to raise more livestock.  Even here in the United States, the majority of the soy bean and corn crops are harvested to feed the animals.  We need those rain forests as this is the counter measure against the methane gas that is so out of control.
1. It is good for the **Animals.**  Since when do we take such glory in being dominate over all the other animals on the planet by eating them?  They have feelings as well and if you ever saw how your meat got to the market, that should put your meat eating days to rest.  It is more torture than slaughter and these animals are stressed out as they head to the gallows.  Don't kid yourself that you are not affected by this action.  Never before has the quote "You are what you eat" been more appropriate.  That stress is passed on to you through your meat consumption.  So do it for the animals and for their sake, if you don't care about the environment.
1. It is good for your **Health.**  I hear lots of people saying they are eating healthy and yet there is still meat and dairy on their plate.  Oh we switched from red meat to chicken.  My gosh, I think that is even worse.  Have you any idea how much bacteria there is in Chicken?  In the whole Covid-19 pandemic you heard that the most vulnerable people where those with compromised immune systems.  Well, eating meat products of any sort compromises your immune system and that is a fact, way too much research to even begin to try and argue that one.  When you are younger, difficulties with your health is not so noticeable as for most the body seems to spring right back and if you only eat meat on occasion your body has an even better chance at fighting back.  Our bodies are remarkable and are totally capable of fighting disease and repairing itself if you provide it with the correct fuel, **whole plant based food**.  I have seen, heart disease, high cholesterol, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, all completely reverse just by changing your diet.  You no longer need to loose memory by taking high cholesterol medication, you have choices.  In fact a whole food plant based diet has been know to improve memory loss.

## Some Facts about your Food
I have heard some interesting stories over the years how people have really improved their eating to be more healthy but they just can't give up the meat.  Besides, Donald, the meat we buy is hormone free and free range chickens.  Here are some facts that you might be missing and what they don't need to tell you or more or less what they (the food industry) define in these cases.  Lets start with a Free Range Chicken.

### Free Range Chicken
The term free range chicken just means that the chicken coop has access to a small outdoor yard.  From the USDA guidelines there is no requirements for length of time spent outdoors, the size of the outdoor area or the type of ground cover.  In fact there is no guarantee that the chicken ever ventured out of the enclosure.  It just means there was a yard that they could get to if they wanted, but more than likely was too heavy to ever bother getting out of the nest but it is still labeled as free range.

### Antibiotics
Did you know that 80-90% of the antibiotics that are made in the USA to fight off viruses and infections are consumed by the livestock industry?  They found that when they inject these antibiotics into the animals, they tend to gain more weight, don't need to report this on any label.  The problem is that we get viruses and other various forms of disease from the animals that we keep in close quarters (a real breeding ground for infectious disease) and because the animals have been injected with antibiotics, the virus mutates itself so when they are passed on to humans, our antibiotics don't work because the virus is already resistant to any of the medicine that we would use to fight it.

### Dairy
It is nice to see that even non-vegans are getting the message about the harmfulness of milk.  All the things that the Dairy industry has been promising has been a lie.  Dairy does not promote healthy bones in fact it weakens the bones and has been proven over and over that it promotes cancer cells.  When I go to the grocery store especially here in California it is a common site to see people going for the dairy alternatives and leave the milk behind.  We are the only mammals in the world that continue to drink milk after we have been weaned and the only species that drinks the milk of another species.  This should have sounded wrong to use a long, long time ago and am glad to see that more and more people are coming to that same conclusion.

### Cheese
One thing I hear from a lot of people is that they too could become Vegan except for the Cheese, just can't give up the Cheese.  Yes you can, and it may not be easy as what is coming through is your addiction to the stuff and that was not done to you by accident.  Before we go too far down that road, lets step back for a minute to talk about why Cheese is so bad.  Cheese is even worse than milk as this is in a very compressed form so all the bad parts are even more dense in the quantity.  Lets stop and think for a minute.  I remember as a kid, the packaging for a slice of cheese, they were trying to prove how healthy this was, there are 4 or 5 glasses of milk in a single slice of cheese.  In a normal life situation is there ever a time when you would drink 4 or 5 glasses of milk in one sitting?  I don't think so, but that is what is happening with every bite of cheese.  The fat content on this stuff is over the top and one of the many contributors to the obesity crisis that we currently face.  You eat that one slice of cheese, you don't feel full, certainly not like I just drank 4 or 5 glasses of milk.  Yet that is exactly what we have done, all 100% of the fat of the milk.  What do you think this is going to do to your arteries?

## Where do you get your Protein, Calcium etc. ?
This is a really easy question to answer, the same place that the cows get it from, **plants**.  Remember, the meat industry wants you to believe that the only source of protein is from meat.  This is clearly not true and we can attest to the fact that some of the largest animals in the world are plant eaters as well. Secondly, the protein from animals is not a good source. Want good protein? then go to the source, **plants**.  This is also where we get our calcium from all those green leafy **plants**.

## Summary
I know that this is a lot to digest but is something everyone needs to start thinking about and kicking into action.  Going **Vegan** can save our planet and put an end to global warming, builds up our karma with the animal kingdom, and just makes us healthy.  This could also put an end to the health crisis.  If everyone is healthy we wouldn't need health insurance.  Hospitals could be closed for the right reasons, because there are no more sick people, not because they have run out of money. If we don't I am afraid that what we have experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic is just going to be the beginning of the continued apocalypse and all I can say is "Welcome to the New Normal" life will never be the same unless we change.
